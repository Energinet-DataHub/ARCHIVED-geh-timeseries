# Test

Read about general QA that applies to the entire Green Energy Hub [here](TODO).

The time series domain has [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) jobs and libraries implemented in Python. So in addition to common test types the time series domain also has a testsuite of [Pytest](https://pytest.org/) unit tests. Information about and instructions on how to execute these tests are outlined [here](/src/streaming/readme.md).
