# Test

Read about general QA that applies to the entire Green Energy Hub here (TODO: Make link when available).

The time series domain has [Databricks](https://databricks.com/) jobs and libraries implemented in Python. Currently, the time series domain has a test suite of [pytest](https://pytest.org/) unit tests. Information about and instructions on how to execute these tests are outlined here (TODO: Make link to `/source/streaming/readme.md` when available).
