# Request for historical time series data

This business process is initiated by a Market Participant submitting a request for historical time series data, which could be relevant for preparing a quotation for a potential consumer. Green Energy Hub will then validate the request, a.o. checking if the Market Participant is allowed to request the time series data. If validation is successful, Green Energy Hub will make the time series data for the configured period available as single aggregated value to the Market Participant.
