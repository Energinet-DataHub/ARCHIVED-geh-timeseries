# Request for time series data

This business process allows a Market Participant to request time series data for one or more Metering Points should there be a need for this. Green Energy Hub will then validate the request, a.o. ensuring the Market Participant is allowed to make such a request. If validation is succesfull, Green Energy Hub will make the time series data for the requested period available to the Market Participant.

Contrary to [Request for historical time series data](https://github.com/Energinet-DataHub/geh-timeseries/blob/UpdateRepoDocs/docs/business-processes/request-for-historical-time-series-data.md) which delivers a single aggregated value to the Market Participant, this business process delivers time series data in the same resolution as the measurements were provided to Green Energy Hub.
