# Submission of time series data

This business process is initiated upon receiving a time series message from a Meter Data Responsible, e.g. the Grid Access Provider in the Danish Electricity Market.  
Green Energy Hub then starts processing the received time series data, covering input and domain validating the data before enriching the data with relevant Metering Point master data and storing it. Green Energy Hub also determines one or more relevant recipients of the time series data at hand, so the time series data may be distributed out of Green Energy Hub.
